# Minecraft Clipboard (the one you used in modpacks)

![splash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13138738/209840593-be6280b3-2e22-4969-ac41-d78cff8946df.jpg)

## Overview

The **Minecraft Clipboard** is inspired by the in-game clipboard from the popular Bibliocraft mod, widely used in modpacks like [Divine Journey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuQYSHROG2XpD93CX9dB8SJw_VaSTLJpr). During my Divine Journey playthrough, I found Bibliocraft's clipboard invaluable for tracking tasks and progress. 

Building on that experience, this project aims to recreate and enhance those features for real-world use, providing a simple yet effective tool for organizing tasks and goals.

Special thanks to [Nuchaz, creator of Bibliocraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bibliocraft), for crafting such an iconic mod that continues to inspire creativity.
