# Minecraft Clipboard (the one you used from bibliocraft)

In my [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuQYSHROG2XpD93CX9dB8SJw_VaSTLJpr](Divine Journey playthrough) I was using bibliocraft's clipboard as a todo/clipboard for tracking game progress.

In other playthroughs, I feel this clipboard has been helpful to me, and so I wanted to create an app with similar features/functionality but for real-life purposes.

Shoutout to [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bibliocraft](Nuchaz owner of Bibliocraft) for creating an amazing mod :)
